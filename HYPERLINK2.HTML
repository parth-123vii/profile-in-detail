<P>I ALREADY KNOW WHY YOU ALL ARE HERE.<BR>
</BR>YOU ALL ARE HERE TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE OR IN SIMPLE WORDS ABOUT MY GOALS.<BR>
</BR>THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT ARE WANTED BY ME TO BE ACHIEVED IN MY LIFE BUT I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF HARDWORK TO ACHIEVE THEM. I WANT TO BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND DO A SIMPLE JOB WITH 
A NICE PACKAGE. TO BECOME A SOFTWARE ENGINEER, I HAVE TO TAKE SCIENCE IN CLASS X AND FOR THAT, I HAVE TO SCORE VERY MUCH IN MATHS AND SCIENCE. AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER, I REALLY LOVE TO PLAY
FOOTBALL AND BADMINTON, SO I HAVE TO BECOM A SPORTS TEACHER SO THAT I CAN TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT THE TRICKS OF FOOTBALL AND FOR THAT, I MYSELF HAVE TO STUDY ABOUT THE TRICKS OF FOOTBALL AND
PRACTICE A LOT. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, I KEPT ON SAYING TO MY PARENTS THAT I WANT TO BECOME A PILOT BUT AFTER I GREW OLDER, I MANAGED TO KNOW HOW HARD THE JOB OF A PILOT IS. I ALSO WANT 
TO TEACH MATHS AFTER I WILL GET RETIRED FROM MY JOB. I ALSO WANT TO LIVE ON HILLISIDE OCE I GROW OLDER AND TAKE A VIEW OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS THERE. THESE WERE SOME GOALS THAT I REALLY 
WANT TO ACHIEVE IN MY LIFE.<BR>
