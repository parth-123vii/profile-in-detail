<P>I KNOW YOU VISITED HERE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT ME.<BR>
</BR>HERE IS A PARAGRAPH THAT TELLS MORE ABOUT ME.<BR>
</BR>I LOVE TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND BADMINTON BUT I AM NOT ABLE TO RUN OR PLAY FAST AS I AM NOT THAT FIT. HOWEVER AFTER GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, I HAVE IMPROVED A LOT. NOW I CAN PLAY AND RUN AT 
A MEDIUM PACE. I LOVE TO WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND STUDY MATHS AT SCHOOL AND TUITION. MY PARENTS HAVE FULFILLED MY EVERY WISH AND AS I AM FROM A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY, THEY FAIL TO FULFILL
SOME OF MY WISHES BUT AS I AM GROWING OLDER, I HAD TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE EXPENSES THAT MY PARENTS HAVE EXCEPT FOR MY WISHES. I AM A PERSON WHO IS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING HE CAN DO. THE 
WORST HABIT OF ME IS THAT, WHENEVER A PROJECT OR WORK IS ASSIGNED, I LET IT PILE UP ON ME AND I THEN BECOME TENSED THAT WHEN WILL I DO THAT WORK BUT THEN ALSO, I MANAGE TO FINISH ALL THE
WORK ON TIME. I AM A PERSON WHO IS CURIOUS TO KNOW EVERYTHING HE CAN DO. I ALWAYS CREATE A LIST OF QUESTIONS IN FRONT OF MY TEACHERS AND PARENTS. I AM NOT AFRAID OF TO SHOW OFF BUT AFRAID 
TO STAY ON TOPIC. I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THE NATURE OF MY FRIENDS BUT THEIR BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ME IS EXCELLENT. I AM AN EXCELLENT COMMUNICATOR AND RESULT ORIENTED. I ALSO REMAIN PASSIONATE
ABOUT MY WORK. I TRY TO REMAIN HIGHLY ORGANISED AND AMBITIOUS. I HAVE A FRIENDLY PERSONALITY AND ENJOY INTERACTING WITH OTHERS EVEN IF THE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME IS THE PERSON WITH WHOM I 
HAVE NEVER INTERACRED.<BR>TO KNOW ABOUT MY GOALS CLICK ON THE LINK NAMELY "MY GOALS" AND TO KNOW ABOUT ME CLICK ON THE LINK NAMELY "I AM PARTH".</BR><BR>
THANKYOU</BR>
